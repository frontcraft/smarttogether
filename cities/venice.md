The city of Venice, 264.886 inhabitants, is a world-renowned touristic destination as well as the capital of Veneto region, hosting all the state, regional and provincial administrative functions and related offices, and two important universities. With about 10 million nights spent every year by tourists, Venice faces important issues related to mass tourism, including solid waste and sewage generation as well as energy consumption. The City of Venice has appointed a Smart City Secretariat to develop and coordinate projects aimed to create a Venetian Smart City and Community. Deeply committed in the field of smart cities, Venice has also signed the Green Digital Charter. The commitment to the reduction of local impacts on the environment is further highlighted by its membership to the Climate Alliance.
