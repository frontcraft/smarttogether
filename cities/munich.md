subtitle: "Neuaubing-Westkreuz/Freiham is the project district in which Munich is implementing the pioneering smart city solutions. Around 30,000 people live in this district on the western edge of the city. Whereas Freiham is a new housing development area, many of the residential properties in Neuaubing-Westkreuz were built in the 1960s and 1970s. Their energy-efficiency standards are comparatively poor."
